# Progress log

Append-only record of every task. Gate-review tasks (M1-59, M2-30, M3-20, M3-62, M4-14) copy statuses from here into the parity matrix.

## Rules

1. Add one entry at the **bottom** when a task finishes (or is blocked). Never edit or delete another entry; correct a mistake with a new entry that references the old one.
2. Use the template exactly. Keep it factual: what changed, how each acceptance criterion was proven, what is left.
3. Evidence is a link or a command with its result: a CI run URL, a test command and its pass count, a screenshot path, a manual check with OS and version.
4. Record anything a task asks you to record here (for example the tauri-specta version in M1-37, the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` finding in M1-06, the first coverage figure in M1-56).
5. If you find a problem outside your task, list it under Follow-ups with a proposed owner workstream; do not fix it in your task.

### PLAN · Planning package produced · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** planning agent   **Reviewers:** pending (user)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/port-plan.md`, `docs/parity-matrix.md`, `docs/ipc-contract.md`, `docs/progress-log.md`, `docs/adr/0001`–`0011`, `docs/tasks/README.md`, `docs/tasks/M0-01` … `M4-16` (174 files), `docs/tasks/check_backlog.py`
- **Evidence:**
  - Brief citations spot-checked against `$POIROT` at `a29dd6e`; 21 corrections recorded in port-plan §3.1.
  - `python docs/tasks/check_backlog.py --poirot C:\Users\pc\Desktop\tech\poirot` → 174 tasks checked, 0 errors.
  - Linux name collision checked on packages.debian.org, archlinux.org and packages.fedoraproject.org (ADR 0011).
  - No `.rs`, `.vue`, `.ts` or `.swift` file created or modified.
- **Follow-ups:** user answers D1–D4 (port-plan §2.2) → Docs (M0-02) and Release (M0-03)

### M0-02 · Record the final app identifier and Linux package name · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** planning agent, acting as technical-writer   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/adr/0011-app-identifier-and-release-repo.md`, `docs/adr/0001-repo-layout-and-swift-reference.md`, `docs/adr/0007-preferences-storage-and-migration.md`, `docs/port-plan.md`, `docs/tasks/M0-01-rules-file.md`, `docs/tasks/M0-02-record-identity-decisions.md`, `docs/tasks/M0-03-repo-bootstrap.md`, `docs/tasks/M2-04-icons-motion.md`
- **Evidence:**
  - User answer, 2026-09-25: follow the recommendations for D1–D3; the folder was moved out of `hydra` (D4).
  - AC1: ADR 0011 status reads Accepted with identifier `io.github.amine-bourouba.heimdall` and package/binary name `heimdall-desktop`.
  - AC2: the identifier uses only `A-Z a-z 0-9 . -` and does not end in `.app`.
  - AC3: `heimdall-desktop` is absent from the Debian/Ubuntu, Arch and Fedora name searches recorded in ADR 0011, each of which lists every package containing "heimdall".
  - AC4: `grep -rn -E "<APP_ID>|<LINUX_PKG>" docs/adr docs/port-plan.md` returns nothing.
  - D4: the project now lives at `C:\Users\pc\Desktop\tech\Heimdall`; `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` there reports "not a git repository", so it is outside `hydra`.
  - Task graph: M0-02 no longer depends on M0-01, and M0-01 now writes the real identifier directly instead of a placeholder. M2-04 gained an explicit M0-01 dependency because it reads the rules file. `check_backlog.py` → 174 tasks checked, 0 errors.
- **Follow-ups:** M0-03 runs `git init` in the new location → Release; M0-01 is the next task to start → Docs

### M0-03 · Initialise the Heimdall repository and its ignore/attribute rules · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** build-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig` (plus `git init -b main`)
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → `C:/Users/pc/Desktop/tech/Heimdall`.
  - AC2: `.gitattributes` has `* text=auto eol=lf` and `fixtures/** -text`; `git check-attr text -- fixtures/windows/x.jsonl` → `unset`, `src/main.ts` → `auto`.
  - AC3: `.gitignore` covers `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `src-tauri/gen/`, `coverage/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/` (and `*.key` so updater keys are never committed).
- **Follow-ups:** none. No commit made yet: commits wait for the user's go-ahead.

### M0-01 · Write Heimdall's AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md and CLAUDE.md · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** documentation-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: `CLAUDE.md` is 3 lines and only points to `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
  - AC2: sections present: Overview, Stack, Layer rules, Icons, Design tokens, Security, Commands, Parallel development (worktrees), Swift reference, Feature development workflow, New Feature Checklist, Git & PRs.
  - AC3: the New Feature Checklist is adapted (Ctrl/Cmd+K, watcher areas, Playwright baselines).
  - AC4: Git & PRs copied verbatim from `$POIROT/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
  - AC5: the Swift-rules grep matches only line 91, inside the Swift reference section.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-04 · Add LICENSE, NOTICE and a scoped README · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** technical-writer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (code-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README.md`
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: LICENSE is MIT with `Copyright (c) 2026 amine-bourouba (Heimdall)` and `Copyright (c) 2026 Leonardo Cardoso (Poirot, …)`; the permission text is byte-identical to Poirot's (`diff` of the body is empty).
  - AC2: NOTICE names https://github.com/a7t-ai/poirot at `a29dd6ee0e0133ef26bd067c164c66b160e13d86`.
  - AC3: `grep -n -i "usage limit" README.md` returns nothing.
  - AC4: every README feature maps to MVP parity rows (B2–B18, B23–B37, C8–C12).
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-05 · Exhaustive inventory of every ~/.claude path Poirot reads or writes · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/claude-home-inventory.md`; planning corrections in `docs/parity-matrix.md` (new row G7), `docs/port-plan.md` (C-22, C-23), `docs/adr/0006-change-propagation-and-caching.md`
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: §6 cross-references every parity row in sections E, F and G, including the new G7.
  - AC2: 110 Swift citations; an automated check confirmed every cited line exists at `a29dd6e`.
  - AC3: §5 lists every `homeDirectoryForCurrentUser`/`NSHomeDirectory` hit.
  - AC4: §7 lists the discrepancies, including `originalPath` versus `projectPath` and the unused `cwd`.
  - New findings: 13 watcher start sites in 8 files (brief said 4); history deletes remove lines by index (D-5).
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-06 · Map every PoirotTests case to its Heimdall destination · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/test-carryover.md`; task inputs updated for M1-10, M2-02, M2-07, M2-14, M3-02, M3-11, M3-31, M3-43 (they now name the Swift tests routed to them)
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: `grep -rho "@Test" $POIROT/PoirotTests | wc -l` = 637; the map has 637 rows.
  - AC2: every destination is an output of some task (checked by script).
  - AC3: drops limited to ClaudeCodeProviderTests, UpdateCheckerTests, `UsageWindowTests.timeUntilReset` (Usage Limits leftover), mocks, and the stale `ScreenshotTests_Usage` skip. HighlightedTextTests has no AttributedString assertions, so all four move to `search/matcher.rs`.
  - AC4: AnalyticsCSVExporterTests maps to Rust with the P-18 reason.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-07 · Behaviour spec for universal search · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/search-overlay.md`
- **Evidence:** all 16 categories with sources, fields and scoping; fuzzy and exact scoring with worked examples verified against HighlightedTextTests; empty-query state; both quick actions; all SearchAction variants; key bindings; 200 ms debounce; custom-folder gap. Every Swift citation resolves (automated check, 23 citations).
- **Follow-ups:** Poirot has 6 SearchAction variants, the contract has 4; the two quick actions need IPC variants when they ship (S17, S18, Later) → Rust data core.

### M0-08 · Behaviour spec for the session browser and conversation view · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/session-views.md`
- **Evidence:** one section per Swift view; every threshold with its source line (page size 20, 80/50-line truncation, 5000-line diff cap, 4 s/10 s toasts, debug-log page 200, and about 25 more); the full toolbar table; buildable skeleton layouts. 109 Swift citations all resolve.
- **Follow-ups:** "Expand All" updates only tool blocks in Poirot; thinking and system blocks ignore it. Decide whether to copy the asymmetry (spec open question 5) → Feature screens (M2-20).

### M0-09 · Behaviour spec for the configuration screens, forms and MCP wizard · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/config-screens.md`
- **Evidence:** a section per screen with read-only versus mutating actions; the full MCP wizard (3 steps, 14 catalog entries, validation, preview); the "Do not port" section with the 4 required items verified plus 6 more (multi-handler hook truncation on edit is the most severe). 163 Swift citations all resolve.
- **Follow-ups:** Swift folds user, local and project MCP sources into one `.user`; the contract keeps five. Keep the contract (richer) and note it in M1-26/M1-45 → Rust data core.

### M0-10 · Behaviour spec for analytics, exports and the context ring · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/analytics.md`
- **Evidence:** exact range and reference-date formulas; every derived series and formatter; six charts; eight stat cards; the Monday-first heatmap algorithm; four CSV formats (always all-time); the PNG snapshot; the 200k/1M context-window rule; staleness rules. 65 Swift citations all resolve.
- **Follow-ups:** 9 open questions about Poirot's own inconsistencies (for example the "(UTC)" hour label on local-time buckets) → Feature screens (M3-31 to M3-34).

### M0-13 · Write the ~/.claude scrubbing tool · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** test-automator (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert, security-auditor)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `scripts/scrub-claude-home.mjs`, `scripts/scrub-claude-home.test.mjs`
- **Evidence:** `node --test scripts/scrub-claude-home.test.mjs` → 10 pass, 0 fail: CRLF kept byte for byte; secrets replaced; home replaced in Windows, macOS, Linux and hyphen-encoded forms; same-length filler with valid JSON; credentials never copied; username, email and client names absent from the output.
- **Beyond the task:** project path segments below the home (for example client folder names) become stable pseudonyms `proj-N` across paths, folder names and config keys; folders whose project path cannot be determined are reported for manual review. Git branch names become filler.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-14 · Capture a scrubbed real Windows ~/.claude tree · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** test-automator (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `fixtures/windows/claude-home/**` (118 files), `fixtures/windows/claude.json`, `fixtures/windows/crlf/**`, `fixtures/windows/MANIFEST.md`
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: MANIFEST records Claude Code 2.1.282, 2026-09-25, Windows build 10.0.26200.9445, counts, and LF endings.
  - AC2: transcripts are LF, so `crlf/` holds a CRLF copy of one 30-line transcript (content identical apart from line ends).
  - AC3: `cwd` values such as `C:\Users\fixture\Desktop\tech\proj-11` are present.
  - AC4: largest file 1 MB (capped); a grep for the real username, email and 13 real project names found nothing.
  - Real-data findings recorded in MANIFEST and fed into M1-14 and ADR 0003: mixed `C:`/`c:` drive case, `cwd` moving into subfolders, orphaned transcripts, synced skills, no `sessions-index.json`, persisted tool outputs. Assumption A-18 answered (LF).
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-15 · Capture a scrubbed real Linux ~/.claude tree · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** test-automator   **Reviewers:** —
- **Status:** blocked
- **Evidence:** WSL is installed (Ubuntu), but it cannot start: `HCS_E_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE` (the Virtual Machine Platform feature is off, which needs admin rights and a reboot). No Linux machine is available.
- **Follow-ups:** the user enables WSL (`wsl --install --no-distribution` as admin, reboot), installs Claude Code in Ubuntu and runs a session; then run the scrub tool there → Testing. This blocks M1-50, M1-54, M1-57 and the M1 gate.

### M0-11 · Extract PoirotTests inline fixtures into a shared synthetic ~/.claude tree · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** test-automator   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `fixtures/README.md`, `fixtures/synthetic/**` (249 files: `cases/` 154 test-case folders, `claude-home/` 24 files, `claude.json`, `project-repo/`, `corrupt/`, `README.md`, `check_fixtures.py`)
- **Evidence:**
  - AC1: the README maps all 164 carried-over Services tests plus 35 decoding tests to existing paths or `inline` (checked by script against test-carryover.md).
  - AC2: `claude-home/` holds one valid instance of every inventory format.
  - AC3: `python fixtures/synthetic/check_fixtures.py` → all checks passed; an independent parse of `claude-home/` and `claude.json` found 0 bad records.
  - Deviation: 5 intentionally invalid per-test inputs stay inside their own `cases/` folder (listed in the README and the check script) instead of `corrupt/`.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M0-12 · Convert ScreenshotData.swift into a deterministic fixture tree · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** test-automator   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `fixtures/screenshot/**` (31 files)
- **Evidence:** the README maps all 60 ScreenshotData declarations; fixed reference date 2026-09-20T12:00:00Z; independent parse of 364 records found 0 bad; no home path other than `/Users/fixture`.
- **Follow-ups:** some mock values cannot come from disk (toasts, standalone tool blocks, illustrative token totals larger than the transcript sums); the README lists them → Testing (M2-24 uses component-level fixtures for those).

### M0-16 · Define and run the upstream Poirot sync check · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** legacy-modernizer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (qa-expert)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `docs/spec/upstream-sync.md`
- **Evidence:** first run 2026-09-25 through a throwaway clone (so `$POIROT` stays untouched): upstream head is `a29dd6e`, 0 new commits.
- **Follow-ups:** next run 2026-10-25 → Legacy parity extraction.

### M1-02 · Create package.json with the full frontend toolchain · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** dependency-manager (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer, security-auditor)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`; task data M1-02, M2-01, M2-23, new task M2-31, M4-08, port-plan P-8
- **Evidence:**
  - `npm ci --include=dev` exits 0; `npm audit --include=dev --audit-level=high` → 0 vulnerabilities.
  - Deviations: `@lucide/vue` replaces the deprecated `lucide-vue-next`; `happy-dom` replaces jsdom (jsdom 30 needs Node 22.22+); WebdriverIO deferred to new task M2-31 because 9.32 pulls a high-severity `extract-zip` advisory.
  - Environment notes for this machine: the shell sets `NODE_ENV=production` (npm skips dev dependencies unless `--include=dev`) and `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` (TLS verification off).
- **Follow-ups:** consider Node 22.22+ or 24 LTS locally (a few transitive dev tools warn on 22.17) → Release.

### M1-04 · Scaffold the Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 frontend · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** vue-expert (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `index.html`, `src/main.ts`, `src/App.vue`, `src/env.d.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`
- **Evidence:**
  - `npm run build` → `dist/index.html`; `npm run typecheck` exit 0; `npm run lint` clean.
  - Throwaway files proved `vue/no-v-html` and the `@tauri-apps/api/core` import ban both fire, and that `src/lib/markdown/MarkdownView.vue` is exempt from the `v-html` ban.
  - Port from `HEIMDALL_DEV_PORT` (default 1420), `strictPort: true`; Tailwind v4 plugin wired.
  - Deviation: one `tsconfig.json` covers the app and config files, so there is no `tsconfig.node.json`.
- **Follow-ups:** M2-06 must import `src/styles/main.css` in `src/main.ts` → Vue shell.

### M1-01 · Create the Cargo workspace, crate manifests and supply-chain policy · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** dependency-manager (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer, security-auditor)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `deny.toml`, `crates/heimdall-core/Cargo.toml`, `crates/heimdall-core/src/lib.rs` (empty placeholder for M1-05), `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- **Evidence:**
  - `cargo metadata --format-version 1` succeeds; `cargo check -p heimdall-core` passes.
  - `cargo tree -p heimdall-core -e normal | grep -c tauri` → 0.
  - Dependencies as listed in the task; tauri-specta and specta pinned to `=2.0.0-rc.25`, specta-typescript to `=0.0.12`.
  - `rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.98.1 (≥ 1.77.2).
  - `cargo deny check` (cargo-deny 0.20.2) → advisories ok, bans ok, licenses ok, sources ok. Getting there: `rust-version` raised from 1.85 to 1.98 so the MSRV-aware resolver stops choosing old crates (this pulled `time` 0.3.55 and `quick-xml` 0.42, fixing RUSTSEC-2026-0009, -0194, -0195); `unmaintained = "workspace"` (the unmaintained `unic-*`, `paste` and `proc-macro-error` crates sit deep in Tauri's tree); `allow-wildcard-paths` for the local path dependency; `tauri-plugin-fs` allowed only as a dependency of `tauri-plugin-dialog`, and `tauri-plugin-shell` stays banned.
  - Package and binary name `heimdall-desktop` (ADR 0011).
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-03 · Scaffold the Tauri app crate with final identity, CSP and module stubs · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (security-engineer, security-auditor, deployment-engineer)
- **Status:** done on Windows; Linux and macOS launch checks wait for CI (M1-58)
- **Files touched:** `src-tauri/src/main.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/build.rs`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/icons/**` (placeholder set from `tauri icon`, mobile folders removed), placeholders for every src-tauri module in ADR 0002
- **Evidence:**
  - `lib.rs` registers opener, dialog, clipboard-manager, store and autostart; setup calls `window`, `menu`, `watcher`, `tray` and `updater` init stubs; tauri-specta's builder supplies the invoke handler and events.
  - `tauri.conf.json`: productName Heimdall, identifier `io.github.amine-bourouba.heimdall`, version from `../package.json`, main window 1280×820 (min 900×600), `csp` and `devCsp` equal to the ADR 0010 strings (compared by script), `freezePrototype: true`, asset protocol off, `withGlobalTauri: false`.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` → exit 0; `cargo build -p heimdall-desktop` links.
  - `npx tauri dev` on Windows 11: process `heimdall-desktop` running with window title "Heimdall", responding; then stopped.
  - Production CSP has no `unsafe-*`; no fs or shell plugin in `Cargo.toml`.
- **Environment notes:** this machine has no MSVC build tools, so it builds with Rust's GNU toolchain plus a portable MinGW (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\heimdall-dev\mingw64`, no admin). The MinGW linker warns "multiple non-default manifests"; the app still runs. Release builds use MSVC in CI.
- **Follow-ups:** install the Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload) for MSVC parity locally → user.

### M1-05 · Declare every heimdall-core module and implement AppError · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/heimdall-core/src/error.rs`, and placeholders for every other module path in the task's Outputs
- **Evidence:**
  - `cargo test -p heimdall-core error::` → 4 passed. One test checks each of the six variants against `{"kind": …, "message": "m", "path": null}`; the others cover `with_path`, `from_io` (Windows sharing violations 32/33 → `busy`) and the `Loaded`/`WriteOutcome` shapes.
  - `AppError` derives `thiserror::Error`, `Serialize` and `specta::Type`; `Loaded<T>` has `value` and `skipped`.
  - `lib.rs` has `#![deny(clippy::print_stdout, clippy::print_stderr)]`.
  - `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc -p heimdall-core --no-deps` → exit 0.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-06 · Claude home resolution, path normalisation and comparison keys · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/paths.rs`
- **Evidence:**
  - `cargo test -p heimdall-core paths::` → 7 passed.
  - `ClaudeHome::for_user_home` and `ClaudeHome::new(root)` take explicit roots; only `from_env` reads the environment, and tests never touch the real home.
  - `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: verified against Claude Code 2.1.282 on this machine. With the variable set to an absolute folder, the CLI reads and writes there instead of `~/.claude`. A relative value is not honoured, so `from_env` accepts absolute values only (test `claude_home_resolution_honours_an_absolute_config_dir_only`).
  - Normalisation tests cover `C:\Users\a\x`, `c:/Users/a/x`, `\?\C:\Users\a\x`, mixed and doubled separators, trailing separators, `/Users/a/x/`, and UNC forms.
  - Comparison keys fold case for Windows and macOS and keep it for Linux. Every function takes `TargetOs`, so all variants run on any host.
  - `same_file` matches on segment boundaries, including `src/a.rs` against `C:\proj\src\a.rs`.
  - `is_unc` detects `\server\share` and `//server/share` but not `\?\C:\`.
  - `decode_project_dir_name` takes an injected `exists` function and is documented as the last-resort fallback.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-07 · Streaming JSONL reader with CRLF and truncation tolerance · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/jsonl.rs`
- **Evidence:**
  - `cargo test -p heimdall-core jsonl::` → 6 passed. The tests cover LF, CRLF, mixed line endings, a UTF-8 BOM, blank lines, an invalid line mid-file and a truncated last line, with the skipped counts asserted.
  - `Records` iterates a `BufReader`; `grep read_to_string crates/heimdall-core/src` finds nothing.
  - `read_head(path, max, qualifies)` reads in 8 KiB chunks and stops after N qualifying lines.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-08 · Serde models for messages, sessions and projects · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/{message,session,project,token_usage,context_usage,session_group}.rs`
- **Evidence:**
  - Test counts: message 19, session 33, project 4, token_usage 10, context_usage 4, session_group 8. There is one Rust test per Swift test in test-carryover.md for these files; session tests that had been merged were split back out to match one to one.
  - IPC structs use `rename_all = "camelCase"` and derive `specta::Type`. `ContentBlock` is tagged by `kind` (`text`, `thinking`, `toolUse`, `toolResult`).
  - The model sentinel is `message::SYNTHETIC_MODEL`.
  - Disk types use `#[serde(default)]` and ignore unknown fields.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-09 · Serde models for stats, history, todos, facets, debug log and file history · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/{stats_cache,history_entry,session_todo,session_facets,debug_log_entry,file_version}.rs`
- **Evidence:**
  - Test counts: stats_cache 12, history_entry 5, session_todo 8, session_facets 12, debug_log_entry 7, file_version 1.
  - `SessionFacets` reads snake_case keys and serialises camelCase (tested).
  - `TodoStatus` accepts `in_progress`, `pending` and `completed`. `list_from_json` skips items with unknown statuses without failing the file (tested).
  - The `costUSD` key is kept exactly.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-10 · Config models, catalogs and the redacting Secret type · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending (architect-reviewer, security-auditor)
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/config/{scope,mcp,hook,sub_agent,command,skill,output_style,plan,memory_file,plugin,settings}.rs`, `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/catalog/{claude_models,mcp_catalog}.rs`, `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/secret.rs`, `docs/ipc-contract.md` (added `McpCatalogEntry`, `McpEnvKey`). Lint fixes in `models/session_group.rs` and `jsonl.rs`, which `cargo clippy --all-targets` flagged.
- **Evidence:**
  - Carried-over tests pass: `cargo test -p heimdall-core` → 210 passed.
    - MCPServerCatalogTests: 14 tests in `mcp_catalog`.
    - Catalog cases from SettingsWriterMCPTests: 4 tests in `mcp_catalog`.
    - MCPServerStatusTests: 7 tests in `mcp`.
    - PlanTests: 8 tests in `plan`.
    - MemoryFileTests: 12 tests in `memory_file`.
    - SubAgentTests: 7 tests in `sub_agent`.
    - ClaudeModelCatalogTests: 7 tests in `claude_models`.
    - Moved elsewhere, as test-carryover.md records: fuzzyMatch cases to M1-29, the plan delete case to M3-42, and SF Symbol cases to M3-14.
  - `Secret`: `Debug` and `Display` print `[redacted]`, and it has no `Serialize`. `McpServer` serialises `envKeys` and `headerKeys`, and skips the value maps.
  - Test `serialised_server_carries_env_key_names_but_never_values` builds a server from `env: {"API_KEY": "sk-123"}` and asserts that the JSON has no `sk-123`.
  - `HookHandler` keeps unknown keys in `extra` and sends only `extraKeys` over IPC (a test asserts that an http header value never reaches JSON). `handler_round_trips_every_key` covers `from_json` → `to_json`. `McpServerDefinition` keeps `type`, `url` and `headers`.
  - Catalogs match Swift entry for entry:
    - MCP catalog: 15 entries in Poirot's order, with ids, env keys and defaults as in Swift. The count is asserted.
    - Model catalog: 5 curated models, with `DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME` "Opus 5" and the same `friendly_name` algorithm.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → exit 0.
- **Deviations:**
  - Icons stay Poirot's SF Symbol names (sub-agents, MCP catalog and its categories); M2-04's icon map converts them to Lucide.
  - `McpServer.status` is not serialised, because the contract sends status separately as `McpStatus`.
  - `McpServerSource` has the contract's five values, not Swift's three.
  - `HookEvent.icon` is not ported to Rust, because no DTO carries it; the hooks UI owns it (M2-04 map).
- **Follow-ups:** none.

### M1-11 · Typed preferences, editor and terminal enums · 2026-09-25

- **Agent:** rust-engineer (executed by the coordinating agent)   **Reviewers:** pending
- **Status:** done
- **Files touched:** `crates/heimdall-core/src/models/prefs.rs`
- **Evidence:**
  - `cargo test -p heimdall-core prefs` → 15 passed; `cargo clippy -p heimdall-core --all-targets -- -D warnings` → exit 0.
  - All 18 keys plus `schemaVersion` have the types and defaults in ADR 0007 (`defaults_follow_adr_0007` counts 19 keys). `claudeCodePath` defaults to null, which means a PATH search.
  - `#[serde(default)]` on the struct:
    - `missing_keys_take_defaults_and_unknown_keys_are_ignored` checks both.
    - `Prefs::from_stored` goes further: a value that no longer parses falls back for that key only, so a downgrade cannot wipe `customMemoryFolders` (`a_bad_value_falls_back_for_that_key_only`).
  - `PreferredEditor` is vscode, cursor, xcode or zed; `options(os)` drops Xcode off macOS.
  - `PreferredTerminal` has the ADR 0003 sets:
    - macOS: Poirot's six.
    - Windows: Windows Terminal, PowerShell, cmd.
    - Linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, kitty, Alacritty, system.
    - Defaults are tested per OS on any host.
  - Carried-over tests: all 6 PreferredEditorTests and all 4 PreferredTerminalTests (checked against the macOS set).
  - `ColorThemeId` has the 20 ids from PoirotTheme.swift.
- **Deviations:** VS Code is stored as `vscode` (ADR 0007), not Poirot's raw value `code`. The raw-value test asserts `vscode`; the CLI command is still `code`.
- **Follow-ups:** `update_prefs` validation (fontScale range and step, per-OS terminal and editor options) and the schema migration hook → M1-39.
